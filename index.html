        <div class="subheading mb-5">Liberal Studies</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Blake Bergman. As a first-generation Liberal Studies major in the College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences at the University of California, Riverside campus, I aspire to work in Public Relations for non-profit benefit organizations.<br><br>

        In my professional experience, I worked at Del Taco for about a month. My duties included cleaning areas of the restaurant and keeping tables orderly, and taking and fulfilling orders from customers, and leading a good attitude at all times. I also volunteered at the YMCA Legal Aid in Redlands, California working for an attorney and senior paralegal. My duties included filing documents, answering telephones, leaving messages, etc. I have also worked part-time at Harkins Theatres in Redlands, in the Mountain Grove 16 location after school. My duties included maintaining cleanliness theatre lobby, bathrooms, and auditoriums, assisting guests with seating and concessions in a friendly and fast manner, operating point-of-sale terminals, assembling food orders, and making accurate change, and collaborating with store managers and supervisors in ensuring the ultimate movie-going experience. I worked there for a little over a year until the Coronavirus pandemic occurred, which meant all movie theatres in the country had to be shut down. <br><br>

        I was born in Fontana, California, and was raised in the San Bernardino/Redlands area. I have 2 parents, a brother and a twin sister, 2 dogs and a cat, and one hamster. I attended Redlands East Valley High School and graduated with a 3.5 GPA. In high school, I was involved in the theatre program working in tech, in which my duties were to assist with lights, sound, and set for theatre at Redlands East Valley High School, planning and setting up light cues, set pieces, sound effects, and microphone work, and collaborating with other technician members in providing successful performances for Drama Club. I was, as well, a part of the badminton and competitive improv teams. I also took a few AP classes in high school, and I was also involved in CNH Key Club International, which was dedicated to community service as a school. I was also on my high school Academic Honor Roll in the years 2016 to 2019. In my spare time, I enjoy spending time outdoors, such as running or swimming; I also enjoy playing sports such as tennis and badminton. Inside, I like playing video games, watching endless Netflix shows, going on social media, and drawing on my tablet. My favorite music is currently pop, alternative, rap, and R&B. Some of my favorite artists include Lorde, Kevin Abstract, Tyler, the Creator, Tame Impala, Lana Del Rey, and Frank Ocean. Some of my favorite travel destinations are Las Vegas, Laughlin, the beach, and Los Angeles. I also work for Postmates part-time with my mother to make extra money during the pandemic.<br><br>
        
        Everything I do is to help myself help others. I enjoy volunteer work and helping the public at the movie theatre because I want the general public to be comfortable and at their best selves. I want to do whatever I can to help others.
